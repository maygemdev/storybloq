# Federation Setup -- Multi-Repo Orchestrator Initialization

This file is referenced from SKILL.md when the user runs `/story federation` or describes a multi-repo project setup. SKILL.md has already determined that federation setup is needed before routing here.

**Skill command name:** When this file references `/story` in user-facing output, use the actual command that invoked you (e.g., `/story` for standalone install, `/story:go` for plugin install).

## What Federation Is

Federation lets one **orchestrator** project coordinate across multiple **node** projects, each in its own repository. Key concepts:

- **Orchestrator**: A storybloq project with `type: "orchestrator"` and a `nodes` map pointing to child project directories. Tracks cross-repo coordination milestones, not per-node implementation work.
- **Nodes**: Independent storybloq projects in separate directories/repos. They don't know they're in a federation -- they work exactly like standalone projects.
- **`dependsOn`**: Build-order topology between nodes. Used for DAG visualization and dispatch ordering.
- **`links`**: Runtime integration points between nodes (informational, not enforced).
- **`crossNodeBlockedBy`**: Ticket field on orchestrator tickets referencing work in node projects (e.g., `["engine:DEV01-T-010", "client:DEV01-T-005"]`). Used to block coordination milestones until node work completes.
- **`federation.allowNodeWrites`**: When true, orchestrator MCP tools can write to node `.story/` directories.

The orchestrator does NOT duplicate per-node work. It tracks only cross-node coordination points (milestones). Each node manages its own tickets, phases, issues, and handovers independently.

## Step 0: Check Existing State

Before starting the setup flow, check if the current project is already an orchestrator:

1. Call `storybloq_status` (or read `.story/config.json` directly).
2. If `type` is `"orchestrator"` and nodes are already configured, this is an existing orchestrator. Do NOT restart the full setup flow. Instead, show the current federation state and use `AskUserQuestion`:
   - question: "This project is already an orchestrator. What would you like to do?"
   - header: "Federation"
   - options:
     - "Add more nodes" -- proceed to Step 3 (node registration only)
     - "Show node details" -- call `storybloq node list` via CLI or read `config.json`
     - "Bootstrap uninitialized nodes" -- proceed to Step 4

If NOT an existing orchestrator, continue to Step 1.

## Step 1: Detect Intent and Gather Context

Federation setup triggers when the user says: "multi-repo", "federation", "multiple projects", "orchestrator", "separate repositories", "monorepo with separate repos", or describes a system spanning multiple codebases.

Before asking questions, scan the context:
- Does the user's message list specific project directories or repo names?
- Is there an existing `.story/` in the current directory?
- Are there multiple related project directories nearby?

## Step 2: Interview

Ask the user about their multi-repo setup. Combine into as few `AskUserQuestion` calls as practical.

**Orchestrator location:**

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- question: "Where should the orchestrator project live?"
- header: "Location"
- options:
  - "Current directory" -- use the current directory as the orchestrator
  - "Create new directory" -- ask for a name, create it
- (Other always available for a specific path)

If the current directory already has `.story/` with `type` != `"orchestrator"`, warn: "This directory has an existing non-orchestrator `.story/`. Converting to orchestrator will change its type and add federation fields. Proceed?" Use `--force` with init.

**Node projects:**

Ask as free text: "List your node projects -- one per line with name, path, and optional runtime links. Example:
```
engine ~/Developer/my-engine
client ~/Developer/my-client [links to engine via wire-protocol]
studio ~/Developer/my-studio [links to engine via streaming-API, links to client via playground]
```"

Parse the response into name/path/links tuples. Validate:
- Names match `^[a-z][a-z0-9_-]{0,63}$`
- Paths point to existing directories
- No duplicates

If the user provides names but no paths (just repo names), ask for paths. Runtime links are optional and informational -- if the user omits them, that's fine.

**Dependencies:**

Ask: "Which nodes depend on which? This defines build order. Example: `client depends on engine`, `studio depends on client, engine`"

Or use `AskUserQuestion` if there are few nodes:
- question: "What's the dependency order?"
- header: "Deps"
- options based on the node list, e.g.:
  - "Linear chain (A -> B -> C)" -- each depends on the previous
  - "Star (all depend on one core)" -- ask which is the core
  - "Independent" -- no dependencies
  - "Custom" -- ask for explicit dependency map

**Write permissions:**

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- question: "Should orchestrator tools be able to write to node projects' .story/ directories?"
- header: "Writes"
- options:
  - "Yes (Recommended)" -- enables creating tickets, updating status, etc. from the orchestrator
  - "No" -- read-only federation; each node manages its own .story/

## Step 3: Create Orchestrator and Register Nodes

**3a. Initialize the orchestrator:**

If the orchestrator directory doesn't have `.story/` yet:
```
storybloq init --name <name> --type orchestrator
```
Or via MCP: call `storybloq_init` with `type: "orchestrator"`.

If converting an existing project: use `--force`.

**3b. Register each node:**

For each node, in dependency order (leaves first). Include `--link` flags if the user provided runtime links during the interview:
```
storybloq node add engine --path ~/Developer/my-engine --stack swift-spm --role "Core engine"
storybloq node add client --path ~/Developer/my-client --stack npm --role "TypeScript SDK" --depends-on engine --link engine:wire-protocol
storybloq node add studio --path ~/Developer/my-studio --stack npm --role "Web app" --depends-on engine client --link engine:streaming-API --link client:playground
```
Or via MCP: call `storybloq_node_add` with all fields including `links`:
```
storybloq_node_add: name "client", path "~/Developer/my-client", stack "npm",
  dependsOn ["engine"], links [{"to": "engine", "via": "wire-protocol"}]
```

Narrate each registration:
```
-> storybloq . node "engine" added (~/Developer/my-engine, swift-spm)
-> storybloq . node "client" added (~/Developer/my-client, depends on engine, links to engine via wire-protocol)
```

**3c. Set write permissions if requested:**

If the user chose "Yes" for write permissions:
```
storybloq config set-federation --allow-node-writes
```
To disable later: `storybloq config set-federation --no-allow-node-writes`.

## Step 4: Bootstrap Node Projects

For each node that doesn't have `.story/` yet:
```
storybloq init --node <name>
```
Or via MCP: call `storybloq_node_init` with the node name.

This creates `.story/` in the node's directory using the orchestrator's config as context (e.g., inheriting `stack` as the project `type`).

For nodes that already have `.story/`, skip this step for those nodes.

Narrate:
```
-> storybloq . bootstrapped "engine" at ~/Developer/my-engine
-> storybloq . "client" already has .story/, skipping
```

## Step 5: Design Orchestrator Phases and Milestones

**Important:** `storybloq init --type orchestrator` created a default "milestones" phase. For simple projects (2-3 nodes), use this single phase. For larger projects (4+ nodes or complex dependency topology), replace it with multiple phases that capture the orchestrator's own lifecycle -- the coordination journey from design through completion.

The orchestrator does NOT duplicate per-node work. Its phases represent cross-node coordination stages, not implementation phases. Each milestone ticket gates on specific node tickets via `crossNodeBlockedBy`.

### Simple projects (2-3 nodes): use the existing milestones phase

Create milestone tickets in the "milestones" phase:
```
storybloq ticket create --title "Core connectivity verified" --type task --phase milestones
storybloq ticket update DEV01-T-001 --cross-node-blocked-by server:DEV01-T-010,client:DEV01-T-008
```

### Larger projects (4+ nodes): replace with lifecycle phases

Delete the default milestones phase and create phases that reflect the platform's coordination lifecycle. Common pattern:

| Phase | Purpose | Example tickets |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| design | Architecture specs, protocol definitions, review resolution | Wire protocol spec, architecture decision records |
| infrastructure | Shared CI, test fixtures, Docker images | Protocol fixture files, contract test CI templates |
| foundation | Core connectivity proven across key nodes | "Server core operational" (cross: server:DEV01-T-020), "Client operational" (cross: client:DEV01-T-012) |
| platform | Major features integrated across nodes | "Studio MVP operational" (cross: studio:DEV01-T-009), "Mobile SDK operational" (cross: mobile:DEV01-T-008) |
| completion | Full feature set, hardening, release readiness | "Platform hardened" (cross: all nodes), "v1.0 release ready" |
| documentation | Shared docs (API reference, deploy guide) | API reference, deployment guide, contributor guide |

Create the phases:
```
storybloq phase delete milestones
storybloq phase create --id design --name "Design" --label "DESIGN" --description "Architecture specs, protocol definitions" --at-start
storybloq phase create --id infrastructure --name "Infrastructure" --label "INFRA" --description "Shared CI, test fixtures" --after design
storybloq phase create --id foundation --name "Foundation" --label "FOUNDATION" --description "Core connectivity proven" --after infrastructure
...
```

Then create milestone tickets in each phase with `crossNodeBlockedBy`:
```
storybloq ticket create --title "Wire protocol v1 spec" --type task --phase design
storybloq ticket create --title "Server core operational" --type feature --phase foundation
storybloq ticket update DEV01-T-002 --cross-node-blocked-by server:DEV01-T-020
```

### Guidelines for all projects

- **Use `crossNodeBlockedBy` on every coordination milestone.** This is what makes orchestrator tickets meaningful -- they gate on real node work. Example: `--cross-node-blocked-by engine:DEV01-T-020,client:DEV01-T-012`
- **Placeholder refs are OK.** Node tickets don't need to exist yet -- refs resolve once created during per-node setup (Step 6).
- **Ask the user** what the major cross-repo coordination points are, or infer from the dependency topology and build order.
- **Don't create generic phase-label tickets** like "Phase 1 complete." Each milestone should describe a concrete coordination outcome: "Wire protocol contract verified," "Studio playground streams via client SDK."
- **Set `blockedBy` between orchestrator tickets** to capture the dependency chain between milestones (e.g., foundation milestones block platform milestones).

## Step 6: Per-Node Setup

For each node that was just bootstrapped, offer to run the setup flow:

Use `AskUserQuestion`:
- question: "Set up tickets and phases for each node now?"
- header: "Nodes"
- options:
  - "Yes, guide me through each (Recommended)" -- run the setup-flow.md interview for each node
  - "Set up one at a time" -- start with the first node, return here after each
  - "Skip" -- the user will set up nodes later by cd-ing into each and running `/story`

If "Yes": for each node, either:
- Use `--node` from the orchestrator directory (requires `allowNodeWrites: true`): `storybloq phase create --node engine --id foundation --name "Foundation" --label "PHASE 1" --description "..." --at-start`, `storybloq ticket create --node engine --title "..." --type task --phase foundation`
- Or use MCP tools with the `node` parameter: `storybloq_ticket_create` with `node: "engine"`, `storybloq_phase_create` with `node: "engine"`, etc.
- Or instruct the user to open a new terminal in each node directory and run `/story`

After setup is complete, run `storybloq status` from the orchestrator to show the full federation view.

## Reference: Studio Orchestrator Example

The studio project at `~/Developer/studio` is a real 8-node orchestrator managing a media production platform:

```json
{
  "type": "orchestrator",
  "nodes": {
    "engine": {
      "path": "~/Developer/AVEngine",
      "stack": "swift-spm",
      "role": "Headless video/audio engine",
      "health": "green",
      "dependsOn": []
    },
    "conductor": {
      "path": "~/Developer/AVConductor",
      "stack": "swift-spm",
      "role": "Tool domains bridging AgentKit -> Engine + Glaze",
      "health": "red",
      "dependsOn": ["engine", "components", "agent"],
      "links": [
        { "to": "agent", "via": "BackendRouterProvider" },
        { "to": "engine", "via": "EngineSessionBridge" }
      ]
    }
  },
  "federation": {
    "allowNodeWrites": true
  }
}
```

Key patterns:
- The orchestrator has a "milestones" phase with coordination tickets using `crossNodeBlockedBy`
- Each node is an independent project with its own phases, tickets, issues, and handovers
- The dependency graph (via `dependsOn`) drives the Mac app's DAG visualization
- `links` document runtime integration points between nodes
- `health` is updated manually or by federation-aware status scanning
